/-! # Namespace example

It is **preferred that you avoid the use of auxiliary definitions** in your theorems. However, if you
do need to use them, as in this example:

-/

noncomputable def average_range (f : ℝ → ℝ) (x k : ℝ) : ℝ := (f (x + k) - f x) / k

end algebra_9173

open algebra_9173

/-
Determine the relationship between the average rates of change k₁ and k₂ for the sine function y = sin(x) near x = 0 and x = $\frac{\pi}{2}$ respectively.
-/
theorem algebra_9173 :
    ∀ᶠ k in nhdsWithin 0 {x | x ≠ 0}, average_range sin 0 k > average_range sin (π / 2) k := by sorry

# Inline Example

Instead of using auxiliary definitions, you inline these definitions by defining and specifying the properties as hypotheses to the theorem itself.
This is the preferred method of including specified values and functions in your theorems.
